# Supply-Chain-Analysis

### Motivation behind doing this project and background of the project: 

Global trade relies heavily on efficient and cost-effective shipping, making it a critical component of the modern economy. As businesses continue to expand their reach across borders, understanding the intricacies of international shipping becomes imperative. Our project, aims to explore the various factors that contribute to the cost and efficiency of shipping goods around the world. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset that tracks international shipments, we seek to uncover insights into what drives shipping costs.

### A Summary of the Data:
The dataset that we chose - "Supply Chain Shipment Pricing Data" comprises 10,324 rows and 33 columns, detailing the distribution and pricing of health commodities, particularly focusing on Antiretroviral (ARV) and HIV lab shipments to various countries. It encompasses a wide range of data categories, including shipment IDs, project codes, country of destination, management details, shipment modes, product descriptions, quantities, values, and pricing, as well as manufacturing site information. The dataset provides a comprehensive overview of the logistical aspects and associated costs of delivering vital health commodities, highlighting the complexity and scale of international health aid supply chains. This dataset can serve as a crucial resource for analyzing supply chain efficiencies, costs, and the impact of such shipments on global health initiatives.
